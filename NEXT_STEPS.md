# Next Steps - RAG System

**Quick reference for what to work on next**

---

## üéØ Immediate Priorities (This Week)

### 1. Add Search Interface ‚≠ê **Most Important**
**Why:** Core RAG feature - users need to search their documents!
**Where:** New tab in scratchpad or separate panel
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create search input component
- [ ] Display search results with document citations
- [ ] Show relevance scores
- [ ] Highlight matching text
- [ ] Link to source documents

**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours

---

### 2. Improve Error Handling
**Why:** Better user experience, reduce confusion
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Install toast library (`npm install sonner`)
- [ ] Replace `alert()` with toast notifications
- [ ] Add retry button for failed uploads
- [ ] Show detailed error messages
- [ ] Add error boundaries in React

**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours

---

### 3. Add Document Metadata Display
**Why:** Users want to see what they've uploaded
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Show file size, type, upload date
- [ ] Display chunk count and token usage
- [ ] Add preview/download buttons
- [ ] Show processing time

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

---

### 4. Implement Title Generation
**Why:** Current conversations show "New Conversation" - not helpful
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Generate title from first user message
- [ ] Update conversation on first message send
- [ ] Allow manual title editing
- [ ] Truncate long titles gracefully

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

---

## üî• Quick Wins (< 1 hour each)

Do these when you have 30-60 minutes:

- [ ] **Add document count badge to pool cards** (30 min)
- [ ] **Show "X documents, Y tokens" summary** (30 min)
- [ ] **Add "Copy message" button to chat** (30 min)
- [ ] **Add pool description to selector dropdown** (30 min)
- [ ] **Show character count in notes/journal** (30 min)
- [ ] **Add confirmation dialogs for delete actions** (45 min)
- [ ] **Implement "Clear completed todos" button** (30 min)
- [ ] **Add "Download as Markdown" for conversations** (1 hour)

---

## üì¶ Technical Improvements

### Testing (Important before production)
- [ ] Set up pytest for backend
- [ ] Add tests for RAG endpoints
- [ ] Set up React Testing Library
- [ ] Write component tests for RAG UI
- [ ] Add E2E tests with Playwright

**Estimated Time:** 20-30 hours (can be done incrementally)

---

### Performance
- [ ] Add Redis caching for embeddings
- [ ] Implement pagination for document lists
- [ ] Add lazy loading for conversation history
- [ ] Configure connection pooling
- [ ] Add request size limits

**Estimated Time:** 8-12 hours

---

## üé® Polish & UX

### Notifications & Feedback
- [ ] Toast notifications for all actions
- [ ] Loading skeletons (not just spinners)
- [ ] Optimistic UI updates
- [ ] Progress bars for long operations

### Accessibility
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+K for search, etc.)
- [ ] ARIA labels on all interactive elements
- [ ] Focus management in modals
- [ ] Screen reader announcements

### Mobile
- [ ] Responsive panel layout

- [ ] OCR for scanned PDFs
- [ ] Table extraction and preservation
- [ ] Multi-language support

### Collaboration

## üí° Ideas for Exploration

- **AI-powered document summarization** on upload
- **Automatic tagging** based on content
- **Smart chunking** that understands document structure
- **Conversation insights** (topic extraction, sentiment)
- **Usage analytics** (most queried docs, search patterns)
- **RAG quality metrics** (answer relevance scoring)
